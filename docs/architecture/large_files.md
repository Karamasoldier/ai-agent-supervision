# Large File Architecture

## Overview
Architecture optimized for handling very large files (80GB+) in the AI agent supervision platform.

## Components

### Storage Layer
- MinIO object storage (S3-compatible)
- Data partitioning strategy
- Compression pipeline

### Processing Layer
- Chunked processing algorithms
- Memory-efficient stream processing
- Background workers (Celery)

### Interface Layer
- Progressive loading patterns
- Data sampling for visualizations
- Real-time progress indicators

## Data Flow
1. Files stored in object storage
2. Processing done in manageable chunks
3. Results streamed to frontend
4. Visualizations operate on sampled/aggregated data

## Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of worker nodes
- Read replicas for frequent access
- Cache strategies for intermediate results
